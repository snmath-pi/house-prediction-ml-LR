# House Price Prediction Model using California Housing Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the California Housing Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features such as location, house age, rooms, bedrooms, population, households, and median income, which are utilized to train a predictive model.

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Conducted feature scaling and normalization where applicable to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized the distribution of house prices and explored correlations between features using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Analyzed the impact of different features on house prices to gain insights for feature selection.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Chose `Linear Regression` from `scikit-learn` for its simplicity and interpretability.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
   - Trained the model on the training set and tuned hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Visualized predictions versus actual prices to assess model accuracy and potential areas for improvement.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Demonstrated how to use the trained model for making predictions on new data.

## Results and Insights

- Achieved an R-squared value of X%, indicating that our model explains X% of the variance in house prices based on the selected features.
- Identified key predictors of house prices such as median income and location, which significantly influence predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or transformations to enhance model performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with ensemble methods or more complex algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the model using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
